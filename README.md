# **Brain MRI Age Classification Using Deep Learning**

This example shows how to work with an MRI brain image dataset and how to use transfer learning to modify and retrain ResNet-18, a pretrained convolutional neural network, to perform image classification on that dataset.

### About the Data
The MRI scans used in this example were obtained during a study \[1\] of social brain development conducted by researchers at the Massachussets Institute of Technology (MIT), and are available for download via the OpenNEURO platform:
    https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000228/versions/1.1.0

### About the Workflow 
This example uses the horizontal midslice images from the brain MRI scan volumes and classifies them into 3 categories according to the chronological age of the participant:
1. Participants Aged 3-5
2. Participants Aged 7-12
3. Participants older than 18, classified as Adults

This example works though multiple steps of a deep learning workflow:
- _Exploring_ a public brain MRI image dataset
- _Preparing_ the dataset for deep learning
- _Training_ a deep learning model to perform chronological age classification
- _Evaluating_ the trained model
